1.  Build this circuit:

    ![Fritzing for a buzzer, laser diode, LDR, and button dim=400wL](laser-tripwire-fritzing.png "Fritzing for a buzzer, laser diode, LDR, and button") ![Schematic for a buzzer, laser diode, LDR, and button dim=400wL](laser-tripwire.png "Schematic for a buzzer, laser diode, LDR, and button")

2. Make sure to aim the laser diode directly at the LDR. *Note: Never look into a laser pointer directly!*
