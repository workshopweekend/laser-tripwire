# Laser Tripwire

Laser Tripwire is a simple implementation of a laser-triggered alarm. A light-dependent resistor in a voltage divider circuit is kept low by shining a laser on it. Interrupting that laser beam sends the analog input over a threshold, triggering the alarm and sounding a buzzer until a reset button is pressed.
