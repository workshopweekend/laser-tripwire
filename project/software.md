1.  Copy this code into a new Arduino sketch:
    <%= laser_tripwire.ino =%>

2.  Upload the project.

3.  Observe the values in the serial monitor to make sure that your threshold value is just slightly higher than the values you observe when the laser is hitting the LDR. Modify your threshold value if necessary.
